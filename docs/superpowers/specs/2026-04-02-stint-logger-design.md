# LMU Endurance Protocol Client — Design Spec

A lightweight Python CLI tool that captures stint activity data from Le Mans Ultimate via shared memory and writes structured JSON session logs.

## Goals

- Track stint data during Practice, Qualifying, and Race sessions
- Capture pit stop details: entry/stand/exit timing, tire changes with wear, fuel/energy added, repairs, driver changes
- Compute per-stint stats: duration, lap count, fuel per lap, energy per lap
- Support multi-driver team events (detect driver swaps)
- Output one JSON file per session for post-session review
- Pure CLI — start before race, stop after with Ctrl+C

## Non-Goals

- No real-time dashboard or UI
- No persistent database
- No strategy planning or comparison features
- No tracking of other cars on the grid (only the player's car)

## Dependencies

- **pyLMUSharedMemory** — shared memory access to LMU (zero external deps, Python 3.7+)
- Python standard library only beyond that

## Architecture

Single-process, three logical components:

```

- **Poller** (`poller.py`) — main loop reading shared memory via `pyLMUSharedMemory.lmu_data.SimInfo` at 1 Hz using copy mode (access_mode=0) for data safety.
- **Stint Detector** (`detector.py`) — compares current vs. previous tick state to detect pit transitions, driver changes, lap completions, and session start/end.
- **Session Accumulator** — built into the detector; maintains the in-memory session and stint list.
- **JSON Writer** (`writer.py`) — serializes session data to JSON. Flushes to disk on every stint completion and every 30 seconds as a crash safety net.

## Detection Logic

### Pit State Machine

pyLMUSharedMemory `mPitState` values:
- 0 = None (on track)
- 1 = Request
- 2 = Entering
- 3 = Stopped
- 4 = Exiting
- 5 = Garage

The player vehicle is identified via `playerVehicleIdx` (indexes into `telemInfo`). The matching `vehScoringInfo` entry is found by matching `mID`, as the two arrays may be ordered differently in multiplayer.

**Drive-through detection:** if the car enters pit lane (state 2) but never reaches a box state (3/4/5), no stint is finalized and the current stint continues.

**Timing:**
- `pit_stand_elapsed` — set on the first box state (3, 4, or 5) seen after pit entry
- `pit_depart_elapsed` — updated on each transition *between* box states (e.g. 3→4, 4→5); the last recorded value represents when service completed
- `pit_exit_elapsed` — set when the car returns to on-track state (0/1)
- `standing_time_seconds = pit_depart_elapsed - pit_stand_elapsed`

**Known LMU state sequences:**
```
2→3→4→0   (normal)          : stand=3, depart=4, exit=0  ✓
2→4→5→0   (LMU variant)     : stand=4, depart=5, exit=0  ✓
2→3→0     (no inter-box tx) : stand=3, depart=3 (fallback), standing_time=0
```

For the `2→3→0` sequence (short stop with no intermediate state), `standing_time_seconds` will be 0 because there is no inter-box state transition to record service completion. This is a known limitation at 1 Hz polling resolution.

### Driver Change Detection

Compare `mDriverName` from pre-pit snapshot vs. post-pit snapshot on the player's vehicle scoring entry. If different → `driver_change: true`, `new_driver` set to post-pit name.

### Session Detection

- **Start:** `mGamePhase` transitions to a non-garage phase (formation lap, green flag, etc.) while valid scoring data is present. Supported session types: Practice 1-4, Qualifying 1-4, Warmup, Race 1-4.
- **End:** `mGamePhase` becomes Over (8), or user sends Ctrl+C (SIGINT).
- **Session type:** read from `scoringInfo.mSession`.

### Lap Completion

Detected by `mTotalLaps` incrementing on the player's vehicle. Used for per-lap fuel/energy tracking.

### Tire Change Detection

Compare pre-pit and post-pit tire data per wheel using `mWheels[i]`. A tire is considered "changed" if:
- `mCompoundIndex` changed (unique compound ID per car+track compound list), OR
- Wear value resets (post-pit `mWear` > pre-pit `mWear` + 0.001 threshold)

`mCompoundIndex` is the primary signal as it distinguishes compound variants within the same type category (e.g. two different Softs). The wear-reset fallback catches same-compound fresh-set swaps.

LMU only updates per-wheel tyre wear reliably for the local/current driver. If either the pre-pit snapshot or post-service snapshot is remote-controlled (`mControl == 2`), tyre change details are not derived for the rich `pitstop` summary and `tyres` is serialized as `{}`. Remote-controlled stints serialize `tyre_wear` as `null`.

### Repair Detection

Compare `mDentSeverity` values (8 positions) from pre-pit snapshot vs. post-pit snapshot. If any value decreased, `repair_flag: true`.

Repair detection also depends on comparing local telemetry before and after service. If either side of the pit stop is remote-controlled, `repair_flag` is omitted from the serialized `pitstop`.

### Tracking API Pit Events

When API publishing is enabled, the client emits these pit events:

| Event | Moment |
|-------|--------|
| `pit_entered` | Car crosses into pit lane |
| `pit_at_box` | First tick at the pit box (`PIT_STOPPED`, `PIT_EXITING`, or `PIT_GARAGE`) |
| `pit_departed` | Service is complete and the car leaves the box |
| `pit_exited` | Car crosses back onto the track |
| `pitstop` | Rich pit summary emitted at pit exit |

`pit_at_box` and `pit_departed` carry a live snapshot in `meta` only when the client is the current driver:

```json
{
  "fuel_litres": 72.34,
  "energy_percent": 54.32,
  "tyre_wear": {
    "FL": 0.8123,
    "FR": 0.7988,
    "RL": 0.8457,
    "RR": 0.8235
  }
}
```

If the car is remote-controlled, those phase events are still emitted but the telemetry snapshot is omitted.

### Pre-Event Practice API Mode

When started with `--practice --practice-team-member-id <uuid>`, API publishing targets a practice tracking session instead of the race session:

- The client creates/resumes the practice session with `POST /api/tracking/registrations/{regId}/practice/sessions`.
- All published driver and pit events include `practiceSessionId`.
- Shutdown marks the practice session ended with `PATCH /api/tracking/practice/sessions/{sessionId}`.
- Race-mode behavior is unchanged when `--practice` is omitted.

Practice mode emits `lap_completed` when `mTotalLaps` increments and local telemetry is trustworthy (`mControl != 2`). The event meta is:

```json
{
  "lapTimeSeconds": 124.318,
  "tyreWear": {
    "fl": 92.44,
    "fr": 91.71,
    "rl": 87.04,
    "rr": 86.55
  },
  "energyPct": 73.23,
  "fuelLitres": 48.46
}
```

`lapTimeSeconds` comes from scoring `mLastLapTime`. `tyreWear` is percent remaining from `mWheels[i].mWear * 100`, lower-case wheel keys to match the API contract. Remote-controlled laps are skipped because the API requires tyre wear and LMU does not update local wheel wear reliably for remote drivers.

## Output

### File Location & Naming

```
sessions/{date}_{time}_{track}_{session_type}.json
```

Example: `sessions/2026-04-02_18-30-00_LeMans24h_Race.json`

The `sessions/` directory is created automatically and gitignored.

### Flush Strategy

- **On stint completion** — immediate write after each pit stop is finalized
- **Every 30 seconds** — periodic safety flush while a stint is active
- **On shutdown** — final flush on Ctrl+C, finalizing the current stint with available data

## CLI Interface

```bash
# Start tracking (auto-detects session from shared memory)
python -m lmu_ep_client

# Terminal output example:
# [14:30:05] Waiting for LMU session...
# [14:31:12] Session detected: Le Mans 24h — Race
# [14:31:12] Vehicle: Porsche 963 (Hypercar)
# [14:31:12] Stint 1 started — Driver: PlayerName
# [15:27:45] Pit entry detected
# [15:28:08] Pit exit — standing time: 23.2s | +97.7L fuel | +94.8% energy | Driver change: TeammateName
# [15:28:08] Stint 2 started — Driver: TeammateName
# ...
# [18:30:00] Session ended. Saved: sessions/2026-04-02_14-31-12_LeMans24h_Race.json
```

Ctrl+C triggers graceful shutdown with final data flush.

## Edge Cases

- **Game not running:** Poller waits in a retry loop, printing status every 10 seconds
- **Mid-stint crash (tool crash):** Periodic 30s flush minimizes data loss; last incomplete stint may have partial data
- **Qualifying (short stints):** Same logic applies; each pit in/out cycle is a stint
- **Practice (frequent pits):** All pit cycles tracked regardless of session type
- **No pit stop in session:** Single stint recorded with `pit_stop: null`
- **Multiple driver changes in one pit:** Only the final driver name post-pit matters
- **Session starts in pit/garage:** Stint start is deferred until the car first leaves the pits; the initial garage exit is not recorded as a pit stop
- **Drive-through penalty:** Car enters pit lane (state 2) but never reaches a box state; no stint is finalized
- **Multiplayer sessions:** Player vehicle identified by `mID` match between telemetry and scoring arrays, not by array index, to correctly isolate the local player's car
- **Short stop, `2→3→0` path:** `standing_time_seconds` will be 0 — known limitation, no inter-box state transition available to record service completion at 1 Hz polling
